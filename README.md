# Hi, Iâ€™m Sergio GarcÃ­a ðŸ‘‹

### Physiotherapist, director of _Reactiv Fisioterapia_ and a student of software development applied to robotics.

**In the field of physiotherapy** I specialise in biomechanics and active rehabilitation. I have written 2 books on biomechanics and training applied to injuries, one aimed at the lower limb and the other at the upper limb, both validated by the University of Castilla La-Mancha.

**In the field of software development and robotics** I am learning to implement solutions with Python, C++ and Arduino.
