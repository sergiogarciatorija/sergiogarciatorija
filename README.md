- 👋 **Hi, I’m Sergio García**
- 👀 I’m interested in **_health_**, **_robotics_** and **_machine learning_**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, soon, C++ and machine learning.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on projects in healthcare solutions and mechatronic or robotic development, but I still have some learning to do before I'm ready to be ready for the next step.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can find me at @reactiv_fisioterapia for health related stuff and on my GitHub profile for programming and development.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can't stand still, I've just started my own clinic and I'm already involved in so many other projects...
